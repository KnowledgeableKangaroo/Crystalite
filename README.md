# Welcome to Crystalite

## About

This is my first website in HTML I have coded. It started in a camp, and I started expanded on it. Unfortunately, it had many bad pracitcs in it and didn't look very well. The website is now refactored to match HTML5 practices and improve appearance. This is for my private use, but, as it is open source, I am open to any improvements, feedback, issue, pull reuqests, and contributions. 

The website home page can be found [here](HomePage.html).
